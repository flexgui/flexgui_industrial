# FlexGui-Industrial
FlexGUI 4.0 is based upon popular web technologies: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. This way it is possible to run FlexGUI 4.0 on PC, Android, iPhone, Windows Phone and generally on every device with a modern browser. You will have exactly the same user experience on each of them. FlexGUI 4.0 communicates using ROS, which is an open-source project that provides a well established platform for Industry 4.0, IoT. The framework supports many robots, PLCs, cameras etc. and by following some single tutorials you can implement your own driver as well.
